# language-rug package

A Rug language package for the Atom editor.

## Installing

As we currently don't release this package to atom.io, you have to manually install it.

```
cd ~/Development
git clone git@github.com:atomisthq/language-rug.git
```

Now create a symlink in your Atom packages directory:

```
cd ~/.atom/packages
ln -s ~/Development/language-rug language-rug
```

Restart Atom and open a `.rug` or `.rt` file.
